online-anonymity
================

Research and briefly describe what the TOR network is and how it works. (2 marks)

```
Tor is an "onion routing" system which makes a PC's net address untraceable by bouncing the encrypted data it sends throughseveral randomly selected computer servers on a volunteer network - each of which removes a level of encryption - before it reaches its destination.

```
Tor was first created by the US military but is now also used by pro-democracy campaigners, whistleblowers and journalists operating under repressive regimes. There are also many hidden sites on the network ending in the .onion suffix, which cannot be found using Google or other regular search engines. One site receives as many as 500 page views per second, its founder says.
